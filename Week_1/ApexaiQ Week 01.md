- **Due diligence** is the **careful investigation, review, or analysis** of a company, system, process, or investment **before making a decision**.
- In IT and cybersecurity, it often refers to **checking systems, software, and security practices** to ensure they meet standards and are risk-free.

---

**Why Due Diligence Matters**

1. **Risk Assessment:**
   - Identifies potential **security vulnerabilities, compliance issues, or operational risks**.
2. **Informed Decision-Making:**
   - Helps businesses decide whether to **buy, invest, or implement a system or software**.
3. **Compliance & Legal Protection:**
   - Ensures **regulatory requirements are met**, avoiding penalties or legal issues.
4. **Financial Security:**
   - Prevents losses from bad investments, security breaches, or non-compliant systems.

## **26. Role of ITAM in Zero Trust Security Models**

- **Zero Trust Security** means **never automatically trusting any device or user**, whether inside or outside the network. Every access request is verified before granting permissions.
- **IT Asset Management (ITAM)** plays a key role by **providing complete visibility and control over all IT assets**, which is critical for Zero Trust.

**How ITAM Supports Zero Trust:**

1. **Asset Discovery & Inventory**
   - ITAM identifies all devices, software, and users in the network to **ensure nothing is untracked**.
2. **Access Control**
   - Helps determine **who can access what resources** based on device type, user role, and compliance status.
3. **Vulnerability & Patch Management**
   - Ensures all devices are **updated and secure**, reducing potential attack points.
4. **Continuous Monitoring**
   - Provides ongoing insights into **device status, compliance, and security posture** to enforce Zero Trust principles.

## **27. Cyber Asset Attack Surface Management (CAASM)**

- **CAASM** is the practice of **discovering, mapping, and monitoring all IT assets to reduce the attack surface**.
- It integrates data from ITAM, security tools, and cloud environments to give **a complete view of potential entry points for attackers**.

**Benefits of CAASM:**

- **Comprehensive Visibility** – Identifies all assets, including shadow IT and cloud resources.
- **Risk Reduction** – Highlights vulnerabilities that attackers could exploit.
- **Improved Security Decisions** – Prioritizes high-risk assets for patching or protection.
- **Supports Zero Trust** – Helps enforce strict access and security policies based on asset risk.
